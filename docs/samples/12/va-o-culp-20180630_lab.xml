    <label xlink:type="resource" xlink:label="label_cafr_SpecialRevenueFundMember" xlink:role="http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/documentation" xml:lang="en">Special revenue funds are used to account for and report the proceeds of specific revenue sources that are restricted or committed to expenditure for specified purposes other than debt service or capital projects. The term proceeds of specific revenue sources establishes that one or more specific restricted or committed revenues should be the foundation for a special revenue fund. Those specific restricted or committed revenues may be initially received in another fund and subsequently distributed to a special revenue fund. Those amounts should not be recognized as revenue in the fund initially receiving them; however, those inflows should be recognized as revenue in the special revenue fund in which they will be expended in accordance with specified purposes. The restricted or committed proceeds of specific revenue sources should be expected to continue to comprise a substantial portion of the inflows reported in the fund. Other resources (investment earnings and transfers from other funds, for example) also may be reported in the fund if those resources are restricted, committed, or assigned to the specified purpose of the fund. A stabilization arrangement (as discussed in paragraphs .180 and .181of Section 1800) would satisfy the criteria to be reported as a separate special revenue fund only if the resources derive from a specific restricted or committed revenue source. Governments should discontinue reporting a special revenue fund, and instead report the fund’s remaining resources in the general fund, if the government no longer expects that a substantial portion of the inflows will derive from restricted or committed revenue sources. Resources restricted to expenditure for purposes normally financed from the general fund may be accounted for through the general fund provided that applicable legal requirements can be appropriately satisfied; and use of special revenue funds is not required unless they are legally mandated. The general fund of a blended component unit should be reported as a special revenue fund. Special revenue funds should not be used to account for resources held in trust for individuals, private organizations, or other governments. Governments should disclose in the notes to the financial statements the purpose for each major special revenue fund—identifying which revenues and other resources are reported in each of those funds.</label>

Net (expense) revenue is sometimes referred to as the "net cost" of a function or program and represents the total expenses of the function or program less its program revenues—that is, charges or fees and fines that derive directly from the function or program and grants and contributions that are restricted to the function or program. An objective of using the net (expense) revenue format is to report the relative financial burden of each of the reporting government's functions on its taxpayers. This format identifies the extent to which each function of the government draws from the general revenues of the government or is self-financing through fees and intergovernmental aid. As discussed in paragraph .135Open this link as a new document, this notion of burden on the reporting government's taxpayers is important in determining what is program or general revenue. General revenues, contributions to term and permanent endowments, contributions to permanent fund principal, special and extraordinary items, and transfers should be reported separately after the total net expenses of the government's functions, ultimately arriving at the "change in net position" for the period. An example of a format that meets these requirements is illustrated in paragraph .142Open this link as a new document. 17 [GASBS 34, ¶38, as amended by GASBS 63, ¶8; GASBS 37, ¶11]
At a minimum, the statement of activities should present:

a.    Activities accounted for in governmental funds by function, 18 as discussed in Section 1800, paragraphs .132–.137Open this link as a new document, to coincide with the level of detail required in the governmental fund statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances

b.    Activities accounted for in enterprise funds by different identifiable activities.</label>

Governments should report governmental, proprietary, and fiduciary funds to the extent that they have activities that meet the criteria for using those funds. a. Governmental fund reporting focuses primarily on the sources, uses, and balances of current financial resources and often has a budgetary orientation. The governmental fund category includes the general fund, special revenue funds, capital projects funds, debt service funds, and permanent funds. Governmental funds are, in essence, accounting segregations of financial resources. Expendable assets are assigned to the various governmental funds according to the purposes for which they may or must be used; current liabilities are assigned to the fund from which they are to be paid; and the difference between governmental fund assets and deferred outflows of resources, and liabilities and deferred inflows of resources, the fund equity, is referred to as "Fund Balance."</label>

These should be reported separately from grants and contributions that may be used either for operating expenses or for capital expenditures of the program at the discretion of the reporting government. These categories of program revenue are specifically attributable to a program and reduce the net expense of that program to the reporting government. For example, a state may provide an operating grant to a county sheriff's department for a drug-awareness-and-enforcement program or a capital grant to finance construction of a new jail. Multipurpose grants (those that provide financing for more than one program) should be reported as program revenue if the amounts restricted to each program are specifically identified in either the grant award or the grant application.

As the nucleus of the financial reporting entity, the primary government generally is the focal point for the users of the financial statements. Thus, it is important to define the primary government and determine what it comprises. A primary government is any state government or general purpose local government (municipality or county). A primary government is also a special-purpose government (for example, a school district or a park district) that meets all of the following criteria:
 
 a. It has a separately elected governing body.
 
 b. It is legally separateOpen this link as a new document (see paragraph .114Open this link as a new document).
 
 c. It is fiscally independentOpen this link as a new document of other state and local governments (see paragraphs .115–.117Open this link as a new document).
 
 [GASBS 14, ¶13]
 A primary government consists of all the organizations that make up its legal entity. All funds, organizations, institutions, agencies, departments, and offices that are not legally separate are, for financial reporting purposes, part of a primary government. If an organization is part of a primary government, its financial data should be included with the financial data of the primary government. [GASBS 14, ¶14]</label>

Some grants and contributions consist of capital assets or resources that are restricted for capital purposes—to purchase, construct, or renovate capital assets associated with a specific program. These should be reported separately from grants and contributions that may be used either for operating expenses or for capital expenditures of the program at the discretion of the reporting government. These categories of program revenue are specifically attributable to a program and reduce the net expense of that program to the reporting government. For example, a state may provide an operating grant to a county sheriff's department for a drug-awareness-and-enforcement program or a capital grant to finance construction of a new jail. Multipurpose grants (those that provide financing for more than one program) should be reported as program revenue if the amounts restricted to each program are specifically identified in either the grant award or the grant application. Multipurpose grants that do not provide for specific identification of the programs and amounts should be reported as general revenues.</label>

Governments should report governmental, proprietary, and fiduciary funds to the extent that they have activities that meet the criteria for using those funds. a. Governmental fund reporting focuses primarily on the sources, uses, and balances of current financial resources and often has a budgetary orientation. The governmental fund category includes the general fund, special revenue funds, capital projects funds, debt service funds, and permanent funds. Governmental funds are, in essence, accounting segregations of financial resources. Expendable assets are assigned to the various governmental funds according to the purposes for which they may or must be used; current liabilities are assigned to the fund from which they are to be paid; and the difference between governmental fund assets and deferred outflows of resources, and liabilities and deferred inflows of resources, the fund equity, is referred to as "Fund Balance."</label>

It also includes the long-term amount of loans and notes receivable, as well as property acquired for resale. However, if the use of the proceeds from the collection of those receivables or from the sale of those properties is restricted, committed, or assigned, then they should be included in the appropriate fund balance classification (restricted, committed, or assigned), rather than nonspendable fund balance.

    <label xlink:type="resource" xlink:label="label_cafr_StatementOfActivitiesTable" xlink:role="http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/documentation" xml:lang="en">The operations of the reporting government should be presented in a format that reports the net (expense) revenue of its individual functions. Net (expense) revenue is sometimes referred to as the "net cost" of a function or program and represents the total expenses of the function or program less its program revenues—that is, charges or fees and fines that derive directly from the function or program and grants and contributions that are restricted to the function or program. An objective of using the net (expense) revenue format is to report the relative financial burden of each of the reporting government's functions on its taxpayers. This format identifies the extent to which each function of the government draws from the general revenues of the government or is self-financing through fees and intergovernmental aid. As discussed in paragraph .135Open this link as a new document, this notion of burden on the reporting government's taxpayers is important in determining what is program or general revenue. General revenues, contributions to term and permanent endowments, contributions to permanent fund principal, special and extraordinary items, and transfers should be reported separately after the total net expenses of the government's functions, ultimately arriving at the "change in net position" for the period. An example of a format that meets these requirements is illustrated in paragraph .142Open this link as a new document. 17 [GASBS 34, ¶38, as amended by GASBS 63, ¶8; GASBS 37, ¶11]
At a minimum, the statement of activities should present:

b.    Activities accounted for in enterprise funds by different identifiable activities.</label>

Fiduciary funds should be used to report assets held in a trustee or agency capacity for others and therefore cannot be used to support the government's own programs. The fiduciary fund category includes pension (and other employee benefit) trust funds, investment trust funds, private-purpose trust funds, and agency funds. The three types of trust funds should be used to report resources held and administered by the reporting government when it is acting in a fiduciary capacity for individuals, private organizations, or other governments. These funds are distinguished from agency funds generally by the existence of a trust agreement that affects the degree of management involvement and the length of time that the resources are held.

        Financial statements of fiduciary funds should be reported using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. The recognition of certain liabilities of defined benefit pension plans and other postemployment benefit plans is discussed in Sections Pe5Open this link as a new document, “Pension Plans Administered through Trusts That Meet Specified Criteria—Defined Benefit,” and Po50Open this link as a new document, "Postemployment Benefit Plans (Other Than Pension Plans) Administered through Trusts That Meet Specified Criteria—Defined Benefit."

        Required financial statements for fiduciary funds are the statement of fiduciary net position and the statement of changes in fiduciary net position. 1 Fiduciary fund financial statements should include information about all fiduciary funds of the primary government, as well as component units that are fiduciary in nature.</label>

Activities are required to be reported as enterprise funds if any one of the following criteria is met. Governments should apply each of these criteria in the context of the activity's principal revenue sources. 5
 
 a. The activity is financed with debt that is secured solely by a pledge of the net revenues from fees and charges of the activity. Debt that is secured by a pledge of net revenues from fees and charges and the full faith and credit of a related primary government or component unit—even if that government is not expected to make any payments—is not payable solely from fees and charges of the activity. (Some debt may be secured, in part, by a portion of its own proceeds but should be considered as payable "solely" from the revenues of the activity.)
 
 b. Laws or regulations require that the activity's costs of providing services, including capital costs (such as depreciation 6 or debt service), be recovered with fees and charges, rather than with taxes or similar revenues. 
 
 c. The pricing policies of the activity establish fees and charges designed to recover its costs, including capital costs (such as depreciation or debt service).</label>

Those committed amounts cannot be used for any other purpose unless the government removes or changes the specified use by taking the same type of action (for example, legislation, resolution, ordinance) it employed to previously commit those amounts. The authorization specifying the purposes for which amounts can be used should have the consent of both the legislative and executive branches of the government, if applicable. Committed fund balance also should incorporate contractual obligations to the extent that existing resources in the fund have been specifically committed for use in satisfying those contractual requirements.
