Charges for services includes charges to customers, applicants, or others who purchase, use, or directly benefit from the goods, services, or privileges provided, or are otherwise directly affected by the services. Includes revenue from fees charged for specific services, such as water use or garbage collection; licenses and permits, such as dog licenses, liquor licenses, and building permits; operating special assessments, such as for street cleaning or special street lighting; and any other amounts charged to service recipients. Fines and forfeitures are also included in this category because they result from direct charges to those who are otherwise directly affected by a program or service, even though they receive no benefit. Should also include payments from other governments for goods or services—for example, when County A reimburses County B for boarding County A's prisoners.</label>

A transfer is a flow of assets (such as cash or goods) without equivalent flows of assets in return and without a requirement for repayment. This category includes payments in lieu of taxes that are not payments for, and are not reasonably equivalent in value to, services provided. In governmental funds, transfers should be reported as other financing uses in the funds making transfers and as other financing sources in the funds receiving transfers. In proprietary funds, transfers should be reported after nonoperating revenues and expenses.</label>
